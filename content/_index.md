I am pursing a degree in Data Science at Duke University, specializing on Data Engineering, Cloud Computing and Natural Language Processing. I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from University of Sheffield (UK), and a former PhD researcher in biomechanics at Imperial College London. Having worked across many industrial and academic sectors, I developed a strong passion in data analytics, programming, and cloud computing, and I am eager to leverage my interdiscinplinary potential beyond the scale of traditional engineering field. Nice to meet you!
